# Hey you
You'll probably want to download a specific file and not the whole repo. So use this browser extension to do just that : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitzip-for-github/ffabmkklhbepgcgfonabamgnfafbdlkn?hl=en

You can use everything in this repo for your own stuff for free. I'd be pleased if you'd consider subscribing to my channel :
